# Sat 28/07/2018 20:40LT , i guess i just complete the general thing: page+responsiveness + signup-app, still a LOT of testing to run 
# through , also code readability optimizing, need to reed through these BEM methodology, then need to upload the whole thing onto the
# server and run same tests from there. host/server is php+mysql same as mine here on pc. Will see.
