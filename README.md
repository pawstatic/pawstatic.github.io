1) create landing with BS4 and scss - check with pixelperfect
2) signup modal
3) ng-app for signUp procedure.

# ng-app: 
# 1)create part views- ngRouter, $location.path etc.
# 2)data structure, array
#    database, create table, check ajax protocol- both post+get to/frm 
#    mysql db.
# 3)attach all var and values to view
# 4)index.html/section3 'Pets and their humans love us':
#   generate data from scope.array to view, ng-repeat.

# ngApp: by now complete Signup-1 and Signup-3 features,
# main struggle is around  ajax comms html <-> server(php -[mySql] ), should be in time for monday noon.

# Sat 28/07/2018 20:40LT , i guess i just complete the general thing: page+responsiveness + signup-app, still a LOT of testing to run 
# through , also code readability optimizing, need to reed through these BEM methodology, then need to upload the whole thing onto the
# server and run same tests from there. host/server is php+mysql same as mine here on pc. Will see.

# data, but refusing to save any the payment data.
